---

## What is a Website?

A **website** is a collection of static or semi-static pages accessible via the internet.  
It primarily focuses on **information delivery**, not interaction.

ðŸ“˜ Example:
- A company portfolio page (like `openai.com`)
- A blog or news site (like `medium.com` or `bbc.com`)

### Basic Architecture of a Website
[User Browser] â‡„ [Web Server] â‡„ [Static HTML/CSS/JS Files]


- The browser sends a request to the web server.
- The server responds with pre-built HTML pages.
- Little to no backend logic is executed per user request.
