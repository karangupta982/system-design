# Load Balancing in System Design

---

## 1. What Is a Load Balancer?

A **Load Balancer** is a system component that distributes incoming network traffic or requests evenly across multiple servers or resources.

Its main goal is to:

* Prevent any single server from becoming overloaded.
* Improve system reliability, performance, and scalability.

In essence, a load balancer acts as the **traffic manager** of your infrastructure.
