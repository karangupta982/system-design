# Time in System Design

---

## 1. Why Time Matters in System Design

In system design, **time** is not just about clocks or timestamps — it’s about maintaining the **correct order of events** across a system.

Time helps answer questions like:

* Did request A happen before request B?
* Which version of data is the latest?
* How do we synchronize logs, transactions, or messages across servers?

This is simple in **monolithic systems**, but becomes complex in **distributed systems**, where no single global clock exists.

---

## 2. Time in Monolithic Systems

### 2.1. Characteristics

* All components share the same **system clock** (hardware or OS-level clock).
* The entire system runs as a single process or on a single machine.
* Ordering of events is determined by the **local system time**.

### 2.2. Behavior

Since there is only **one clock source**, event ordering is straightforward:

```
T1 → T2 → T3 → T4
```

Each event has a precise timestamp, and all parts of the system agree on it.

### 2.3. Example

In a single-server application:

1. A user sends a request at 10:00:05.
2. The server processes it and stores a log with that timestamp.
3. The next request comes at 10:00:08.

Here, ordering is guaranteed by the single clock of the machine.

## 3. Time in Distributed Systems

### 3.1. Challenge

In distributed systems, multiple nodes (servers) have **their own local clocks**, and these clocks:

* Can **drift** (run at slightly different speeds),
* May not be perfectly **synchronized**, and
* Experience **network delays** when communicating.

Because of this, there is **no single global notion of time**.

### 3.2. Problem Example

Imagine two servers:

* Server A logs an event at 10:00:05.
* Server B logs another at 10:00:04.

If their clocks are not synchronized, you can’t be sure which event happened first.
This uncertainty causes issues in:

* Distributed databases (ordering writes),
* Logging systems (tracing events),
* Messaging queues (event sequence).

## 4. Event Ordering: The Core Issue

In distributed systems, the goal is to determine **happens-before** relationships between events:

* Did event A happen before event B?
* Are A and B concurrent (independent)?

The **happens-before** relation (`→`) defines partial order:

* If A sends a message to B, then `A → B`.
* If A and B occur in the same process and A finishes before B starts, then `A → B`.
* If neither `A → B` nor `B → A`, then A and B are **concurrent**.

Since physical clocks can’t always be trusted, we use **logical clocks** to order events.

## 5. Lamport Logical Clock

### 5.1. What It Is

A **Lamport Logical Clock** is a method to assign **logical timestamps** to events so that we can determine their order **without relying on physical time**.

It was introduced by **Leslie Lamport** in 1978.

### 5.2. Idea

Each process in a distributed system maintains a **counter** instead of a real clock.

Rules for updating this counter:

1. **Increment Rule:**
   Each process increments its counter before every event.
2. **Send Rule:**
   When sending a message, attach the current counter value.
3. **Receive Rule:**
   When receiving a message with timestamp `t`, update your clock as:

   ```
   clock = max(local_clock, t) + 1
   ```

### 5.3. Example

Assume two processes, P1 and P2:

| Step | Action                           | P1 Clock | P2 Clock | Explanation                         |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | P1 event e1                      | 1        | -        | P1 increments its clock             |
| 2    | P1 sends message (clock=1) to P2 | 1        | -        | Message carries timestamp 1         |
| 3    | P2 receives message              | 1        | 2        | P2 sets its clock to max(0,1)+1 = 2 |
| 4    | P2 event e2                      | 1        | 3        | P2 increments before next event     |

**Ordering:**
`e1 → message send → message receive → e2`

Thus, even without synchronized clocks, we can determine that **e1 happened before e2**.

## 6. Key Properties of Lamport Clocks

* Establish **causal ordering** (if A → B, then timestamp(A) < timestamp(B)).
* Do **not** provide total ordering — concurrent events can have the same or incomparable timestamps.
* Lightweight and efficient for event ordering across distributed systems.

---

## 7. Limitations of Lamport Clocks

* They only provide **partial order**, not total order — we know that A happened before B, but can’t tell *how much* before.
* Cannot detect **concurrent events** directly (two events may have timestamps 5 and 5, but occurred independently).
* Don’t represent real-world time.

---

## 8. Extensions: Vector Clocks

To overcome Lamport clock limitations, **Vector Clocks** are used.

* Each node maintains a vector of counters, one per node.
* They can detect **causal relationships** and **concurrency**.
* Used in systems like **Amazon DynamoDB** for conflict resolution.

Example:

* `V(A) = [2,1]` and `V(B) = [1,2]` → concurrent events (no order).
* Helps in **version control** and **data reconciliation**.
