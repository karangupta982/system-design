# gRPC, ConnectRPC, and Communication Between Microservices

When building distributed systems or microservice-based applications, different services often need to communicate with each other. These services may be written in **different programming languages** (for example, a Go backend talking to a Node.js frontend or a Python analytics service).
To enable this communication efficiently, we use **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) frameworks** such as **gRPC**, **ConnectRPC**, and others.

This document explains what they are, how they work, and why they are used.

---

## 1. The Problem: Communication Between Services

In a microservices architecture:

* Each service runs independently.
* Services often use different programming languages.
* They need to communicate to share data or trigger actions.

### Example

A `User Service` written in Go may need to talk to an `Email Service` written in Node.js.
If they communicate using HTTP and JSON, this works but can be **slow and inefficient** for large-scale systems because:

* JSON is text-based and needs serialization and deserialization.
* There is no strict schema, so data inconsistencies may occur.
* Network bandwidth is wasted due to verbose data format.

This is where **gRPC** and similar frameworks come in.

---

## 2. What is gRPC?

**gRPC** (Google Remote Procedure Call) is an open-source high-performance RPC framework developed by Google.
It allows one service to **directly call functions (remote procedures)** in another service — as if they were local functions — even if they are written in different languages.

### Key Features

* Uses **Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)** for data serialization.
* Supports multiple languages (Go, Java, C++, Python, Node.js, etc.).
* Uses **HTTP/2** for communication.
* Supports features like **streaming**, **authentication**, and **load balancing**.

---

## 3. How gRPC Works

The main idea behind gRPC is to use a **shared interface definition** that describes the structure of requests and responses.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Define Service in `.proto` File**
   Example:

   ```proto
   syntax = "proto3";

   service UserService {
       rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
   }

   message UserRequest {
       string user_id = 1;
   }

   message UserResponse {
       string name = 1;
       string email = 2;
   }
   ```

2. **Generate Code for Each Language**
   The `.proto` file is compiled using the `protoc` tool to generate code for different languages.

   * For Go, it generates Go types and functions.
   * For Node.js, it generates JavaScript/TypeScript clients.

   This ensures that both sides understand the same data structure without manually converting formats.

3. **Run the Services**

   * The **server** implements the service (e.g., `GetUser` function).
   * The **client** calls the service using generated code.
   * Data is serialized into a **binary Protobuf format**, sent over HTTP/2, and deserialized back on the other side.

4. **Communication Happens**
   The client simply calls:

   ```typescript
   const response = await userClient.GetUser({ user_id: "123" });
   ```

   It feels like a local function call, but it’s actually a network call handled by gRPC.

## 4. Why gRPC Is Efficient

| Aspect         | gRPC                        | Traditional REST (JSON/HTTP) |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Data Format    | Binary (Protobuf)           | Text (JSON)                  |
| Transport      | HTTP/2                      | HTTP/1.1                     |
| Speed          | Faster (smaller payload)    | Slower                       |
| Type Safety    | Strongly typed via `.proto` | Schema-less                  |
| Streaming      | Supported                   | Limited                      |
| Multi-language | Built-in support            | Manual conversions           |

gRPC is designed for **high performance**, **low latency**, and **multi-language interoperability**, making it ideal for internal microservice communication.

---

## 5. What is ConnectRPC?

**ConnectRPC** (or simply **Connect**) is a modern alternative to gRPC, created by **Buf** (the company behind Protocol Buffers tooling).
It aims to make RPC simpler, more flexible, and web-friendly.

### Key Highlights

* Works over both **HTTP/1.1** and **HTTP/2** (while gRPC mostly requires HTTP/2).
* Uses the same **Protocol Buffers** format as gRPC.
* Fully compatible with **gRPC clients and servers**.
* Easier to use in browsers and TypeScript environments.
* Supports both binary (Protobuf) and JSON formats.

### Why ConnectRPC Exists

gRPC works very well for backend-to-backend communication but is less friendly for browsers and some web-based APIs. ConnectRPC solves this by:

* Supporting **browser clients** directly.
* Providing **simple error handling** and **human-readable responses**.
* Maintaining **backward compatibility** with gRPC.

| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Thrift**   | Developed by Facebook; similar to gRPC but older. | Supports many languages.                                     |
| **JSON-RPC** | Uses JSON instead of Protobuf.                    | Simpler but slower.                                          |
| **GraphQL**  | Query language for APIs, not exactly RPC.         | Great for flexible queries but higher overhead.              |
| **REST API** | The most common approach using HTTP and JSON.     | Easier to use but less efficient for internal communication. |

# Understanding gRPC, REST API, and GraphQL

## 1. Introduction

In any distributed or web-based system, different parts of the application need to **communicate** and **exchange data**.
This communication can happen between:

* **Browsers** and **backends** (for user-facing web apps)
* **Microservices** within a backend (for internal logic)

Different technologies are optimized for these two cases, and this is why we compare **gRPC**, **REST**, and **GraphQL**.

---

## 2. What Are Web APIs?

A **Web API (Application Programming Interface)** is an interface that allows two programs to communicate over the internet using HTTP.
When you open a website or app that fetches data from a server, it usually calls some API.

Example:
When a user logs into a website:

1. The browser sends a request to `https://api.example.com/login`.
2. The server processes the request and sends a response back, such as user details or a token.

This process uses **HTTP** as the transport layer.

---

## 3. Browser APIs vs Web APIs

These two terms often sound similar but have different meanings.

### Browser APIs

* These are **built-in APIs** provided by the web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) for frontend developers.
* Examples:

  * **Fetch API** – for making HTTP requests.
  * **DOM API** – for manipulating web page elements.
  * **LocalStorage API** – for storing data locally.
  * **WebSocket API** – for real-time connections.

These run **inside the browser** and are used by frontend JavaScript code.

### Web APIs

* These are **server-side APIs** exposed over the internet that browsers or other systems can call.
* Examples:

  * `GET /users`
  * `POST /login`
  * `GET /products`

These are usually built using frameworks like **Express (Node.js)**, **Django (Python)**, or **Spring Boot (Java)**.

So, the **browser calls Web APIs** using **Browser APIs** (like `fetch()`).

---

## 4. What Is a REST API?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an **architectural style** for designing web APIs.

It uses **HTTP methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on **resources**.

### Example

Let’s say you have a `User` resource.

| Action | HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description         |
| ------ | ----------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Create | POST        | /users   | Create a new user   |
| Read   | GET         | /users/1 | Get user with ID 1  |
| Update | PUT         | /users/1 | Update user details |
| Delete | DELETE      | /users/1 | Remove user         |

### Characteristics

* Uses **JSON** for data exchange.
* Human-readable and widely supported.
* Simple to implement and debug.

### Why It Works Well with Browsers

* Browsers natively understand HTTP.
* JavaScript (frontend) can easily send JSON requests using `fetch()` or `axios`.
* Great for **public APIs** and **frontend-backend** communication.

---

## 5. What Is GraphQL?

**GraphQL** is an API query language developed by Facebook.

Unlike REST, where you fetch entire resources, GraphQL lets clients **request exactly the data they need**.

### Example

Instead of calling multiple REST endpoints:

```
GET /users/1
GET /users/1/posts
GET /users/1/friends
```

You can send a **single GraphQL query**:

```graphql
{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    posts {
      title
    }
    friends {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Features

* Clients can request only needed fields.
* Reduces over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
* Uses a single HTTP endpoint (e.g., `/graphql`).

### When It’s Useful

* Frontend apps that display complex, nested data (like social media feeds).
* APIs consumed by multiple frontend clients (web, mobile).

---

## 6. What Is gRPC?

**gRPC** is a **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** framework that allows one service to call another service’s function directly, even across different machines or programming languages.

Instead of REST’s “resources,” gRPC focuses on **methods**.

Example (in `.proto`):

```proto
service UserService {
    rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}
```

A client can call:

```typescript
const response = await userClient.GetUser({ id: "123" });
```

This looks like a local function call, but it’s actually happening over the network.

---

## 7. Why gRPC Is Less Browser-Friendly

Browsers have limited ability to handle the **HTTP/2 binary protocol** and **Protobuf serialization** that gRPC uses internally.
Browsers expect standard **HTTP/1.1 requests with text-based JSON responses**, but gRPC is optimized for binary communication.

Therefore:

* Browsers cannot directly make gRPC calls without special adapters or proxies.
* gRPC is designed mainly for **backend-to-backend** communication, not **browser-to-backend**.

To solve this, tools like **ConnectRPC** were created, which work well with both **browsers** and **servers**, while still keeping the efficiency of gRPC.

# Backend-to-Backend Communication Explained

When you hear *"backend-to-backend communication"*, it means **one server (or microservice) talks directly to another server** — **without** involving the browser or frontend.

Let’s break this down clearly.

---

## 1. Typical Web Flow (Frontend ↔ Backend)

Normally, in a web app:

* The **browser (frontend)** sends an HTTP request (e.g., via `fetch()` or Axios) to a **backend server**.
* The **backend** processes the request, fetches data from a database, and sends the response back to the **browser**.
* Example:

  ```
  Browser --> Backend API --> Database
  ```

This is called **frontend-to-backend communication**.

---

## 2. Backend-to-Backend Communication

Now imagine your system is split into multiple **microservices**.
Each service handles a specific task.
For example:

* `Auth Service (S1)` → Handles user login, tokens
* `User Service (S2)` → Handles user profiles and info

When a request comes from the frontend, it might go like this:

```
Browser --> Auth Service (S1)
```

Now S1 realizes it needs user data to verify the request.
So it calls another service internally:

```
Auth Service (S1) --> User Service (S2)
```

Then:

* `S2` processes that request and sends data back to `S1`
* Finally, `S1` sends the combined response back to the **browser**

Full flow:

```
Browser --> S1 --> S2 --> S1 --> Browser
```

This internal communication (`S1 → S2`) is **backend-to-backend communication**.
It **does not** involve the browser directly at all.

---

## 3. Why Backend-to-Backend Exists

When we build a **microservices architecture**, no single service does everything.
Instead, they communicate with each other to perform complete business tasks.

Example:
In an **e-commerce** system:

* The **Order Service** talks to the **Payment Service**
* The **Payment Service** might talk to the **Inventory Service**
* The **Notification Service** sends an email when the order is confirmed

These are all **backend-to-backend communications**.

---

## 4. How Do Backends Communicate?

There are multiple ways:

| Method                           | Description                                                                   | Example                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **HTTP REST APIs**               | Services call each other using HTTP (like normal APIs)                        | `S1 → GET http://userservice/api/users/123` |
| **gRPC**                         | Uses a binary protocol (Protocol Buffers) for faster, typed communication     | `S1` calls `S2` via generated client stubs  |
| **Message Queues**               | Asynchronous communication using tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, etc.             | `S1` publishes message → `S2` consumes it   |
| **GraphQL Federation / Gateway** | One API gateway aggregates multiple services behind a single GraphQL endpoint | `Frontend → Gateway → Multiple Backends`    |

---

## 5. Common Misconception: Browser Involvement

Your assumption was:

> s1 will call browser API → that API will call s2 → then s2 will send info to browser

That’s **not how backend-to-backend** communication works.

Browsers are only for **frontend-to-backend** interaction.
Once the request reaches the backend, all **internal service calls** happen **server-to-server** — completely invisible to the browser.

---

## 6. REST API, GraphQL, and gRPC in Context

These are all **protocols or styles** of how one service communicates with another.

| Type         | Used For                               | Works Over                         | Typical Use                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **REST API** | Browser ↔ Backend OR Backend ↔ Backend | HTTP/JSON                          | Simple and universal       |
| **GraphQL**  | Browser ↔ Gateway OR Backend ↔ Gateway | HTTP/JSON                          | Flexible data querying     |
| **gRPC**     | Backend ↔ Backend                      | HTTP/2 + Protocol Buffers (binary) | Fast, typed internal comms |

So when discussing **microservice communication**, gRPC is compared to REST/GraphQL because all can be used for **service-to-service** calls.

## 7. Summary

| Concept             | Involves Browser? | Used For                            | Example                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Frontend-to-Backend | Yes               | Web app calls backend API           | React app calling Node.js API     |
| Backend-to-Backend  | No                | Microservice A calls Microservice B | Auth service calling User service |

# Frontend to Backend Communication Explained

---

## 1. The Core Idea

**Frontend-to-backend communication** happens when the **frontend (client)** — usually running in a **browser** — sends a request to a **backend (server)** to fetch or send data.

Example:

```
Browser (Frontend) → Backend Server → Database
```

The browser is not just “parsing the response.”
It is also responsible for **initiating requests**, **handling responses**, and **rendering the final UI** for the user.

---

## 2. What the Browser Actually Does

The browser plays multiple roles here:

1. **Initiates the Request**

   * Using JavaScript (`fetch`, `axios`, etc.) or HTML form submissions.
   * Example:

     ```javascript
     fetch("https://api.example.com/users")
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => console.log(data));
     ```

2. **Handles Networking**

   * Opens a TCP connection, sends an HTTP request to the backend.

3. **Parses and Interprets the Response**

   * The backend sends a response (JSON, HTML, XML, etc.).
   * The browser parses this response and updates the web page accordingly.

4. **Renders the UI**

   * If the response contains HTML/CSS, it renders it visually.
   * If the response is JSON, JavaScript code on the page updates the UI dynamically.

So yes — **the browser does parse** the response,
but it also **initiates** the communication and **renders** the result.
It’s not a passive receiver.

---

## 3. Is Browser Always Involved?

No — the browser is **only one kind of client**.

Other ways to make backend calls include:

* **Command-line tools** like `curl` or `httpie`
* **Postman / Insomnia** for testing APIs
* **Mobile apps** (e.g., React Native, Android) making HTTP requests
* **Other backend services** (for backend-to-backend calls)

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/users
```

This does the same thing your browser would do:
send an HTTP request and receive an HTTP response —
but it does **not render or visually display** anything.

---

## 4. What Makes Browser-Based Communication Special

| Aspect                   | Browser                               | Other Clients (like curl)       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **UI Rendering**         | Yes (HTML, CSS, JS)                   | No                              |
| **User Interaction**     | Yes                                   | No                              |
| **Request Automation**   | Triggered by user (clicks, forms, JS) | Triggered manually or by script |
| **Cookies / Sessions**   | Automatically managed                 | Must be handled manually        |
| **Security Constraints** | CORS, Same-Origin Policy              | Not applicable                  |

So, browsers are **specialized clients** that not only send requests but also manage sessions, cookies, security, and UI rendering.

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend**                          | The client (usually a browser) that interacts with users and sends requests to the backend |
| **Backend**                           | The server that processes requests and sends responses (data, HTML, etc.)                  |
| **Browser Role**                      | Sends the request, handles network communication, parses response, renders UI              |
| **Curl Role**                         | Sends and receives data only — no UI or rendering involved                                 |
| **Frontend-to-Backend Communication** | Happens via HTTP (or WebSockets, etc.) over the internet                                   |

## 6. Key Takeaway

* The **browser is a type of client** — not the only one.
* The **backend** doesn’t care who sent the request — browser, curl, or another server — it just processes it.
* What makes the **browser unique** is its ability to **render and display** responses visually to the end user.
