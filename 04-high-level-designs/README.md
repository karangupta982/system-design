# High-Level Designs

This folder focuses on understanding the high-level design of large-scale systems and real-world applications. Each design explains how system components interact, how scalability and performance are achieved, and what architectural choices make these systems reliable and efficient.

## Purpose

The objective of this section is to gain a deeper understanding of system architecture, component communication, and design trade-offs that influence scalability, availability, and maintainability in production systems.

## Folder Structure

Each subfolder represents a high-level design case study:
