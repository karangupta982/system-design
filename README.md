# System Design From Scratch

This repository is a structured guide to learning **System Design from the ground up**, with organized notes, examples, and practical references.
It covers both **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)** concepts, focusing on clarity, scalability, and real-world relevance.

## Overview

System Design is the foundation of building scalable, reliable, and efficient software systems.
This repository organizes key topics into sections — from the basics of scalability to real-world design examples like Netflix, Twitter, and chat-apps.

Each topic is concise, complete, and designed to be beginner-friendly yet industry-relevant.

## Learning Approach

1. Start with `00-roadmap/` for a guided learning sequence.
2. Move to `01-basics/` and `02-components/` to build your fundamentals.
3. Study `03-design-patterns/` to understand how large-scale systems are structured.
4. Explore `04-high-level-designs/` for real-world architectures.
5. Review `05-low-level-designs/` for implementation-level understanding.
6. Use `06-cheatsheets/` and `07-visuals/` for revision and quick recall.
